<h3>Objective:</h3>

<p>	My degree explores the usage of technology, software in the modern world while simultaneously correlating it to what happens behind the scenes (i.e. digital design, audio/light production and graphics). </p>

<p>I have always had a passion for the entertainment industry and learning more about the technological advancements each year advancing music, film, and digital design. This passion carried me into college and has allowed me to specialize in Media Processing: the various services used to provide the media to the public. </p>

<p>I have taken a variety of audio production, digital networking, programming, and technology classes all assisting in my deeper understanding of how the entertainment industry works. I hope this coursework will assist me in my future endeavors.</p>

<h3>Experience:</h3>

<ol type="1">
  <li><b>HeadCount - Team Leader:</b> While working alongside fellow team leaders, HeadCount has allowed me to bring awareness to digital authority, music, and democracy. Working in the fast - paced entertainment industry has granted me the opportunity to correspond with individuals, learning more about their passion for music and entertainment. From there, I am able to provide them with more information about democracy and keeping the industry free for all to enjoy.</li>
  
  <li><b>Director of Continous Recruitment - Alpha Omicron Pi Sorority:</b> Holding an executive position in my sorority granted me the opportunity to coordinate, plan, and execute chapter recruitment events for a group of 100+ women. I have curated events based off of the chapter's specific goals and successfully implemented team meetings to inform the rest of the executive team. Additionally, I maintained official chapter documents and continually update members of upcoming events through weekly emails, social media, and a shared google calander.</li>
  
  <li><b>Future Farmers of America - Reporter and Publicity Coordinator:</b>By working on the Georgia state officer team as the Reporter, I maintained a strong social media presence on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram while monitoring engagement levels. I effectively increased Instagram followers by 600+, contributing to increased engagement of  over 1,400+ new followers on all platforms. I additionally executed marketing campaigns online and in person throughout the community. </li>
