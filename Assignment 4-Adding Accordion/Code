<button class="accordion"><b>Objective:</b></button>
<div class="panel">
  <p class="p2">My degree explores the usage of technology, software in the modern world while simultaneously correlating it to what happens behind the scenes (i.e. digital design, audio/light production and graphics).

    I have always had a passion for the entertainment industry and learning more about the technological advancements each year advancing music, film, and digital design. This passion carried me into college and has allowed me to specialize in Media Processing: the various services used to provide the media to the public. 
    
    I have taken a variety of audio production, digital networking, programming, and technology classes all assisting in my deeper understanding of how the entertainment industry works. I hope this coursework will assist me in my future endeavors.</p>
